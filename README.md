Fully frontend react/bootstrap project.
Done as a project for Matrice.io RNCP6 tuition.

CSS was not part of this project that's why there is a lot of bootstrap and even some inline.
You can check my other projects if you want to see some cleaner Sass code.

I'm also aware that it was not done with the latest React way of creating root.
